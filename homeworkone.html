<h1> Bozell </h1>
 <p>The first website I will critique is my employer's website, <a href="http://bozell.com/">Bozell</a>. The color scheme of this site is very monochromatic. It is mainly a white, grey and black site with several bright green highlights throughout the site, reflecting the company's green of their logo. The monochromatic scheme with several bright green highlights enhanced the overall message as green promotes growth, which is what Bozell always is aligned to do when partnering with a client. The intended audience could be drawn to the site as its simplistic color palette is not too trendy nor is it drab or archaic in use. The use of grey for font touches on the meaning of timelessness - Bozell is a company that has been around since the 1920s and while grey is a great go-to color for a font on a white background, it relates to the timeless and classy nature of the company as well. The use of black for a few miscellaneous elements illustrates the grit of the company. It contrasts with the professionalism of the blank white background, which could be attractive to business people of all ages. The bright green is a draw for edgier crowds as well without being too loud. </p>

<p>The typography on the site uses one type of typography - a sans-serif font called Roboto. This font is seen in many different forms - from all caps to sentence case, as well as many different weights. The use of one font really plays to the feel that the color theme represents - a simple, timeless and bold but professional look that lends itself to the theme nicely. </p>
<p>Overall, the user experience of the site is smooth and promotes the intended goals of the site. The site's main goal is to attract leads to the company, which is done well through promotion of the agency's work, services, and personal aspects such as blogs and personnel. The site also keeps users engaged through interesting content - the listing of the agency's work first is interesting and perhaps a controversial decision but the most important part of advertising is by far the work that is done - so I think that content has been placed in a meaningful order on the page. The user story seems to be well thought out in terms of this order as well. </p>

<h1>Smith Peterson Law Firm</h1>
<p>Next, I will be critiquing my father's work's website <a href="http://www.smithpeterson.com/">Smith Peterson Law Firm.</a>The color scheme is very interesting... It does not fall into a particular color scheme. I might say it is close to a monochromatic site with the exclusion of the navy blue that is present, as the main tones of the site are a golden yellow through a beige or tan color. The use of the blue could represent honesty, which is a quality always necessary in a law firm that wants a good reputation. The uses of the golds and tans could be alluding to a yellow - which would indicate positivity - certainly an interesting meaning since if someone needs a lawyer, they are probably in a negative situation. The color scheme doesn't hurt the message, but it certainly doesn't help it in anyway. It seems the colors are much too bold and deep - and used entirely too much through out the site to have a real impact. These tones may be more impactful had they been used in more meaningful ways. The audience, which is professionals and common people alike for the many different types of laws that are practiced, would not likely be positively affected by this color scheme as it feels heavy and is almost distracting. </p>
<p>The site uses all san serif fonts to enforce their messages. The fonts selected are both timeless and popular, including Verdana, Geneva, Arial, and Helvetica including Helvetica Neue. The fonts selected do seem to match the mood of the page, however the beige/gold colors do indicate more of an older feel which to me would seem to be more fitting for a serif font instead.</p>
<p>The user experience of the site seems to be fairly average. While conversions in the form of contacting the firm are the highest goal of the page, the pages seemed to be merely personalized with information with this one goal in mind. Based on the appearance of this website, it is difficult to tell what the user story may be and how exactly one's goals could be accomplished on the page. </p>

<h1>Flagship Commons Food Hall</h1>
<p>The last critique will be <a href="http://flagshipcommons.com/#intro"> Flagship Commons Food Hall </a>. The color scheme of the page is very monochromatic, using mainly whites, blacks, and greys. These color schemes make sense as the page uses the brilliant color schemes of the individual brands within the hall to add contrast and varying color schemes to the page. The use of a monochromatic scheme like this is highly effective for the general audience they are appealing to - this page is for people of all ages to check out before going to the hall and the black indicates the edgy nature while the white shows the cleanliness and purity of the concept as well. The monochromatic scheme gives the trendy new food court a timeless vibe which will be useful as the concept becomes less trendy over the next few years and will help the website design to stay relevant. </p>
<p>The fonts in use on this site contain a multitude of typographies, both serif and non-serif. From a handdrawn and sketchier look to the more classic look of the loved serif font Courier as well as Georgia, the fonts on this page help to create the mood that Flagship Commons is for everyone. They help to support the tones set by the many parallax effects going on throughout the page, but still maintain the classy and timeless nature of the color scheme in use. </p>
<p>Overall, the user experience of the page is wonderful. It helps to outline the many restaurants that are present while displaying any necessary information about hours, etc. It directs people to food and happy hour specials outright and also directs people to jobs fairly early on in the site, which gives a readily available button for job seekers on the site. While the nature of the site is very Squarespace-esque which may attribute to the solid user experience that it creates, the page overall provides relevant information for the user that is also relevant in any type of user story that may come up. </p>
